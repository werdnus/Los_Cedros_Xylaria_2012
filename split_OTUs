# just the simple command in QIIME to pick OTUs

# download macqiime (http://www.wernerlab.org/software/macqiime)
# I was using MacQIIME version 1.7.0-20130523

# QIIME picks OTUs
# input is all available curated sequences. Quality cut-off below 500 bp and above 1000 bp was imposed. 
pick_otus.py -i StromataEndo_Sequences_500-1000bp.fasta -s 0.97 -o uclust_picked_otus_95
pick_otus.py -i StromataEndo_Sequences_500-1000bp.fasta -s 0.97 -o uclust_picked_otus_97
pick_otus.py -i StromataEndo_Sequences_500-1000bp.fasta -s 0.97 -o uclust_picked_otus_99

# The 97% similarity almost perfectly matches the morphological identifications. The OTU with X. schweinitzii and X. ophiopoda is later split by hand -- 99 (or 98) percent similarity results in over-splitting other groups. 

# revised OTU file, with inserted names and a sum of the number of occurrences, was generated in Excel, and is called 2012_Final_Seqs_otus_97_refined5.csv and 2012_Final_Seqs_otus_97_refined5.xlsx (files are the same, save for formatting bold and italics for scientific names).
